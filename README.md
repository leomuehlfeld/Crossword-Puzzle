# Crossword Puzzle Generator

This project provides a Python script that generates a crossword-style grid filled with words from a `words.json` file. The script arranges words horizontally and vertically, similar to a crossword puzzle. The final output is produced as scalable vector graphics (`.svg`) files, allowing you to view or print the resulting crossword.

## Features
- **Custom Grid Size:** Specify the desired dimensions of the grid (e.g., width and height).
- **Automatic Word Placement:** The script reads from a `words.json` file and attempts to arrange the words in a crossword-like configuration.
- **SVG Output:** Generates `crossword_final.svg` and `crossword_key.svg` for easy viewing, sharing, or printing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crossword-generator.git
   cd crossword-generator```

2. **Create venv (optional)**
```bash 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
``` 

Crossword Puzzle Generator

This project provides a Python script that generates a crossword-style grid filled with words from a words.json file. The script arranges words horizontally and vertically, similar to a crossword puzzle. The final output is produced as scalable vector graphics (.svg) files, allowing you to view or print the resulting crossword.

Features

Custom Grid Size: Specify the desired dimensions of the grid (e.g., width and height).
Automatic Word Placement: The script reads from a words.json file and attempts to arrange the words in a crossword-like configuration.
SVG Output: Generates crossword_final.svg and crossword_key.svg for easy viewing, sharing, or printing.
Requirements

Python 3.7 or later
Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)
Installation

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crossword-generator.git
cd crossword-generator
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Prepare Your Word List:
Add or edit the words.json file with your desired words.
The words.json file should contain a JSON list of words. For example:
["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
Run the Script:
python generate_words.py
By default, the script uses parameters defined within generate_words.py (such as grid size). You can edit the script to change the grid dimensions or other configuration parameters.
View the Output:
After running the script, youâ€™ll find crossword_final.svg and crossword_key.svg in the project directory.
Open the .svg files in a browser or an SVG-compatible image viewer to see your crossword puzzle.
Customization

Grid Size:
Modify the corresponding variables (e.g., GRID_WIDTH, GRID_HEIGHT) in generate_words.py to adjust the puzzle size.
Word Filtering or Processing:
If needed, apply filters, checks, or transformations to the word list before placement within the script.
Output Format:
The script currently outputs .svg files. You can modify the script to generate additional output formats or integrate with other tools.
Troubleshooting

Words Not Fitting:
If the puzzle is not generated as expected, try reducing the number of words or increasing the grid size.
Overlapping or Missing Words:
Check your words.json for typos or duplicates. Adjusting the algorithm in generate_words.py may be necessary for more complex word sets.
